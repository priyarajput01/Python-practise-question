# Exercise 1: Create a list by picking an odd-index items from the first list and even index items from the second
# Given two lists, l1 and l2, write a program to create a third list l3 by picking an odd-index element from the list l1 and even index elements from the list l2.
# 

a = 2

if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:

b = 200
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
